## Neurosymbolic AI in Multi-Agent Systems for Scalable and Explainable Intelligence

Abstract:

Neurosymbolic AI (NeSy AI) represents an innovative approach that blends symbolic reasoning with neural networks, enhancing AI systems' adaptability, transparency, and decision-making efficiency. Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), consisting of independent agents operating in dynamic environments, benefit significantly from this hybrid intelligence. This paper examines how Neurosymbolic AI is transforming MAS by integrating logical inference with data-driven learning, making these systems more reliable and interpretable. We discuss its role in various sectors, including robotics, intelligent transportation, healthcare, finance, and cybersecurity, where balancing reasoning and adaptability is crucial. The paper also explores emerging technologies such as Large Language Models (LLMs), Knowledge Graphs, Logical Neural Networks, and Reinforcement Learning with symbolic integration, which are shaping the future of MAS. Furthermore, advancements in Explainable AI (XAI) and Federated Learning are analyzed in the context of distributed multi-agent collaboration. Despite its promising potential, several obstacles remain, such as computational scalability, balancing interpretability with performance, and ethical considerations related to AI-driven automation. To overcome these challenges, future research should focus on refining real-time decision-making, establishing standardized hybrid AI architectures, and enhancing the generalization capabilities of multi-agent learning models. By merging symbolic logic with neural learning, Neurosymbolic AI is redefining how intelligent agents interact and reason, paving the way for more autonomous, explainable, and effective AI-driven systems. This review highlights its transformative impact across industries while outlining the key hurdles and opportunities for further innovation.
