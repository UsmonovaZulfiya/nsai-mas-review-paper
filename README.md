# Neurosymbolic AI based Multi-Agent Systems: Applications and Reasons Behind

Abstract:

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has already been integrated into most aspects of everyday life to ease complex tasks and improve efficiency.The next step towards the enhancement of its performance is giving meaning and reason for the operations it completes to get more accuracy and interpretability in AI outputs. This desire has founded a new field, Neuro-symbolic AI that aims to address these goals by combining Neural Networks and Symbolic AI. Another important field that has leveraged AI in efficiency is Multi-Agents which can form a system to solve distributed, dynamic problems. The paper explores the importance of the integration of Neuro-symbolic-AI into a MultiAgent System by first providing a brief introduction to both fields, then explaining the reasons for the combination with examples of architecture design. Neuro-symbolic AI-based Multiagents applications in medicine, decision-support systems, the Internet of Things, and some other areas are discussed further. The review analyzes recent advancements in NSAI and MAS by examining the proposed applications in respective domains. It demonstrates how integrating NSAI into MAS can improve the systems’ reasoning, adaptability, and robustness and also gives insights for future research and practical applications.
